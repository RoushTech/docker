# TODO.md

Matt's wants and TODO list

* [ ] Fix the NPM Watcher weirdness.
* [x] Rename the "php" user to be a "app" user so it doesn't feel wierd using "php" as the user for npm commands.
* [ ] I'd quite like it if I could enable a DEVELOPER_MODE inside the containers so that sudo is present for when devs are spelunking around
* [x] Move dockerfile fragments around.
* [ ] PS1 terminal prompt needs a color reset at its begining
